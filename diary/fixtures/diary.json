    "content": "This is such a rollercoaster that I am just desperate to get off. After the almost high of the previous day, I have now plummeted worse than I could've imagined!\r\n\r\nI went to the hospital to have a coupe of skin biopsies, as the dermatologist wants to discover if there is actually any eczema on my body at all, as it could all be RSS. Whilst it was only a minor operation, I am in so much daily pain with the burning in my face and the whole body soreness, going through a procedure like this, though minor, pushed me over the edge!\r\n\r\nI went into the theatre and was told the only real discomfort of the minor op was the administration of the local anaesthetic. Well, they are obviously not used to treating people who's skin does not provide a barrier and when they applied the substance to clean the area, it was agony, it literally burnt like hell.\r\nMy skin is raw and this was a horrendous start. I could see they just didn't get it so they injected me and continued with the biopsy.\r\n\r\nAgain, I reiterate I am already in a state, both mentally and physically, as my day's are just for surviving as best I can so seeing my abdomen covered in blood that they were trying to stop just felt like the lowest point I have had to cope with. They continued and repeated the procedure in my right thigh and once they'd stitched me up told me I couldn't bath for 4-5 day's. I wanted to cry, I was broken! Everybody has a limit to what they take and this was it for me, I just didn't want to continue. For most sufferers that I have come across the bath is one place were their symptoms are momentarily eased. To hear that I couldn't for 4-5 day's was horrendous.\r\n\r\nWhilst I know they are doing this for good reasons as they are trying to find some medication that will help, I still struggled to get it together after this.\r\n\r\nThis is such a tough season, worse than I thought. Through it I know two things are absolutely true.\r\n\r\n1. That God is good and only good in all things.\r\n2. I know he can heal.\r\n\r\nI am not going to lie, hitting such a low has made these truths difficult to reconcile at times. Sickness is not what God originally intended for our bodies but he can use it and use it for our good. Whilst this is hard to see in the midst of sickness, it remains true! I am obviously broken and in need of his healing and He will make good of this, I just don't know what that is yet. I am reminded that before he went to the cross the Lord Jesus pleaded with the Father to take this cup from him and in the same prayer accepted what The Father wanted to accomplish through the life of his perfect Son.\r\n\r\n1 Peter 5:10\r\nAnd the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.",

    "content": "An incredible breakthrough today!\r\n\r\nNot in terms of healing, but I went for my 3 month biologics check up at the hospital to be scored, in order to ascertain whether or not I could continue on Dupilumab. I spectacularly failed the test and it looked like I was going to have to stop it. However, once the nurses had finished with their scoring, I went in to see the dermatologist, who listened to what I was saying and the research I had done in terms of 'topical Steroid Addiction(TSA/TSW). He then summoned in 4 additional Dermatologists, who I briefly recounted my history too. The lead dermatologists confirmed 'Red Skin Syndrome' which is the disease that commences once you go into Topical Steroid Withdrawal.\r\nNeither my Mum or I could believe it, what we were hearing felt like a miracle. So often these visits are followed with an instruction to take more and more topical/oral steroids. It felt like such a breakthrough, the dermatologist, who was the clinical lead even gave reasoning for the full body redness and what was happening to my blood vessels. I now have to go back to the hospital to have a skin biopsy to confirm, but it looks like i'll be getting support from now on in!\r\n\r\nI feel so blessed by God. So many and I mean so many people suffering with this disease do not get a diagnosis or any support and I have just had 5 dermatologists at the hospital hear about 'Red Skin Syndrome' and NOT deny it's existence. God is with us and never leaves us, though it's tough he will see me through.\r\n\r\nPsalm 139 7-10\r\n\r\nWhere can I go from your Spirit?\r\nWhere can I flee from your presence?\r\nIf I go up to the heavens, you are there;\r\nif I make my bed in the depths, you are there.\r\nIf I rise on the wings of the dawn,\r\nif I settle on the far side of the sea,\r\neven there your hand will guide me,\r\nyour right hand will hold me fast.",

I often wake up and dream about what I could achieve with a day and then what i am actually going to be able to do hits me like a punch in the face. So many, in fact most of my day's are something i've just got to get through. That often means long salt baths, remaining inside the home and just wearing pyjamas.\r\n\r\nI additionally struggle with the burden I have become on my family, particularly my wife, who is so supportive, but even for her it all gets too much and seems to go on forever.\r\n\r\nI used to be so active and outgoing, I genuinely loved people and being around them and now even on the odd day I manage to get out I feel like a freak show and try not to look people in the face or make eye contact as I once would.\r\n\r\nI find you just can't get a break from the suffering, it doesn't matter how many antihistimine and pain killers I take, if its not one thing it's another. If it's not sore and causing me a burning pain it's flaking off, oozing and itching like crazy. I hate looking at the piles of dust I create from the itching. Although, I do have to admit that I do not ooze like some of accounts I have read, I do get it behind my ears which has made my face stick to the pillow case and in the beginning on the back of my legs, of which my daughter remarked 'have you just got out the shower?'.\r\n\r\nOn top of this it makes sleep almost impossible unless I take pills which the doctor has told me I shouldn't be taking everyday as I 'll get addicted!\r\nI miss being the husband /dad I was before, I can no longer plan anything and I have had to exclude myself from the last two family holidays.\r\n\r\nI miss the bedtime cuddles I used to have with my kids, I am just so sore it would be so uncomfortable to embrace them.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying, I cannot wait for the day this is finally through with!\r\n\r\nI honestly think these symptoms are enough to drag anyone down, even the happiest most outgoing person in the world.\r\n\r\nI know there is an end to this but it feels so far away.\r\n\r\nPS",

    "content": "Why would anyone go through this harrowing ordeal. Well, the simple answer is that I had no health on the steroids, it was no existence at all. The suffering began literally a day after applying them, red swelling would appear all over my body and i would start to flake off everywhere. In addition, i began experiencing burning pain most commonly around my neck and the inside of my thighs - strange!\r\n\r\nWell, the next question to answer is \"How do I know it's the steroids?\"\r\nI KNOW because I have eliminated every other possibility to try and regain my health. Whatever I tried produced no results, none at all, the painful red skin just keeps coming back!\r\n\r\nI have gone through the elimination diets such as no dairy, eggs, alcohol, gluten, processed food, caffeine and no eating out. Our home is as allergy friendly as it possibly could be. We have no carpets, pets, curtains I damp dust and wash all laundry at a minimum of 60 degrees and use non-biological washing powder. We additionally filter the water we drink and shower with. sO i felt that i had covered every base. I also went on immunosupresents yet the problems still continued.\r\nThat is when I turned to the google and entered my symptoms and discovered the following web pages:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.itsan.org/\r\nhttp://www.red-skin-syndrome.com/dr-marvin-rapaport-md/\r\n\r\nThis is where I found the closest thing to an explanation and honestly it terrified me what I was going to have to undergo to try and get my health back. It's the hardest thing I've ever had to face.\r\n\r\nMy unknown future is the hands of God, he has given me a body that heals and my trust is in him.\r\n\r\nEphesians 6:10\r\nFinally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.\r\n\r\nI could not face this without God because I seriously don't have the strength to face this on my own, so much suffering and it's so prolonged.",

I wish I could say at least the itch had subsided considerably, but literally the only way I can get any relief from it is the shower with the water on the hotter side. It is by far the worst of all the symptoms. The nerve pain, burn, ooze, its smell and the flakiness are disgusting but I can get through them. However, the itch I have experienced with this disease with traumatise me forever, It has a depth and intensity that must be unimaginable to people that are comfortable in their skin. I often feel like I am trying to tear my bones out of my flesh. The itch dominates my life, It determines everything. I do everything I can not see people, such is the fear of being witnessed having a scratching fit.\r\nI have been asked by several people  \"what on earth do you do with your days?\" I always know that these people have never suffered or been tortured by their body. \r\n\r\nI take cyclospornin, this at least allows me to function to some degree and not have to spend all of my time in the bath.

I have a young family and I need to help my wife even a little bit ,as it's been so long. \r\n\r\nI had my contract terminated from my job of 18 years around month 9 and since then I have not brought any money in to the home. I feel so bad to be putting this sort of pressure on my wife but there is just no way I could hold a job down. I have had it suggested to me to apply for help. Well , I did apply for ESA, PIP and UC. All the institutions that exist to help you out if this sort of tragedy befalls you. Sadly, one by one they all shut the door on me. The ESA were particularly cutting when they told me I just looked a bit flushed and should work. Please have a look at the photo gallery even cotton t-shirts are painful to wear.  I was red all over and burning and itching like crazy. I can't even begin to tell you the fear and anxiety I suffered having to go to that meeting.

After that they want you off it for fears of renal injury. \r\n\r\nI have failed so many different drug attempts. I desperately wanted Dupilumab to work and tried it several times but it barely took the edge of. I additionally tried Methatrexate injections on a couple of occasions but again the symptoms came back with a vengeance. So bad in fact that I questioned whether I could go on and thought I was done and needed to find a way out. I also tried Abrocinatib as they said it was doing well in the trials so I did a straight switch to it but the symptoms were horrendous again .\r\n\r\nThe symptoms I cannot cope with physically and mentally are when I am pouring with ooze, waking up in the morning next to my wife soaking wet with my pyjamas and bed sheets stuck to me, fiercely itchy all over, inflammation all over my body, burning and flaking away. This is my experience even after three and a half years without cyclosporine. \r\n\r\nThere is a degree of symptoms which I can tolerate and certainly in the first year I tried taking the disease head on but after months and months of no progress cyclosporine gave me some life back. I initially felt like a failure as the internet is full of people who have healed from this disease and not used immunosuppressants. Resorting to using them makes you feel somewhat inadequate in comparison to them. \r\nHowever, I know I don't have the mental strength to not use them and I will not get through this without help. \r\n\r\nI honestly believed that nothing else could help but I was wrong. I have now been a on a new drug for two months called upadacitinib. I crossed the drugs over for three weeks to avoid a crash but for the first time in two and half or so years I have been able to come off cyclosporine. I am still in disbelief that this is the case. \r\n\r\n I don't believe that any drug is ever going to be perfect. My skin is very dry and I still have rashes that present all over which are itchy but it doesn't seem to be that bone deep itch that you get with tsw. \r\n\r\nIf you are in a similar position to me being forced off cyclosporine and losing hope that anything else will ever help or make a difference to the hellish symptoms,  I hope this article will give you some encouragement.",

Regardless, I did my bloods as per usual. The following Monday I received a call from the nurse telling me that i needed to do a repeat blood test as one of my results wasn’t looking good. That was my liver. \r\n\r\nBefore starting the drug my baseline liver level was 20 and they tell me the lower limit is 4 and the upper limit is 59. That morning she rang to tell me I had exceeded the upper limit and was on 63 but I didn’t need to worry at this stage and just needed to do another blood test. After having this follow up blood test my levels have gone up again to 74 and that is just over a week since my appointment. And yet still they want me to continue on this drug at the same dosage.I was informed that I could just choose to stop but there are not many options for me. What I don’t understand is why they will not try a lower dose of the drug. I really don’t understand this. I was even told it might be unrelated. Which of course it cannot be, nothing else has changed other than the introduction of the drug, therefore , this is certainly not a coincidence.She also asked me if I was a drinker. I haven’t had any alcohol since August 2018. I have indeed told them this many times.\r\n\r\nWell at this point my mental health just crashed and I hit rock bottom. My liver obviously is not coping and there is not a strategy or any proactiveness in place to do something about this and I am supposed to just continue. I feel I am now faced with either driving my liver into the ground and having clear skin or allowing my liver to heal and suffering horrendously again. Just the thought of the latter throws up all the trauma of what I’ve been through and this option terrifies me. How can I possibly chose to wake up next to my wife soaking wet from ooze, sore and freezing cold ,only able to sleep in hot bath water, being tormented by a bone deep itch that tortures you to the very core of your being.The truth is I know I can’t face this again, not physically or mentally. The alternate option doesn’t look to good either. Running another organ into the ground and suffering the consequences of that. \r\n\r\nSo, where do you begin to make such a decision. One thing I do know is that I do not want to procrastinate remaining undecided is a bad decision. To hope things will just improve on there own is just futile thinking and will lead me nowhere good. \r\n\r\nI still have hope in one day being free of this burden and I still have to take courage in the message from Dr Rapaport that this will come to an end. My healing objective still remains and I need help to get to the end. But how to move forward right now seems impossible.",
